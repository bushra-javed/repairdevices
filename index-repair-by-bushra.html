                    an carelessly installed circuit breaker. Circuit breakers must be installed to code for safety and insurance
                    reasons. An unskilled individual could electrocute themselves if they lack the skill and experience of
                    a professional electrician when dealing with high voltage. Mr. Electric is the one to choose to install
                    your new circuit breaker. kkmo Our licensed electricians are prompt, friendly and professional. We'll
                    do the job right the first time. After your new circuit breaker installation, you’ll enjoy the freedom
                    to run the microwave, toaster and air conditioner all at the same time. Your home’s electrical power
                    will have a new infrastructure to keep your all your juice-loving electronics up and running. In addition,
                    your Mr. Electric professional will inspect your entire home electrical system for free.

                    We Can Install Custom-Designed Lights on Your Property
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Lighting is the backbone of our home and office. Without adequate lighting, life becomes an argument between the senses.
                    Poor lighting can reduce the health and safety code of conduct in the workplace, and can increase the
                    risk of headaches and poor vision in the home. Often, a light is only noticed when it's not working.
                    When considering a new lighting installation, hire an electrical contractor who has years of experience
                    and can meet your standards. Lighting is also a great way to rejuvenate home and offices and can transform
                    your view from dull to dazzling. Burtner Electric Inc. can help you install recessed lighting, indoor
                    and outdoor lighting, with a variety of custom designs.

                    Unfortunately, many people don't know they have an electric fault until it's too late. Wires are often hidden from view and
                    can become disrupted or damaged by severe weather, rodents, or general wear and tear. If you suspect
                    that wiring has become loose from the side or roofing of your home, or the interior electrical wiring
                    is “acting up,” it's time to call the pros. Carrying out an electric repair job is far more cost and
                    time effective than waiting for the damage to overflow. It can save you hundreds of thousands of dollars’
                    worth of damage. Facing electrical issues? Call Burtner Electric Inc. immediately. We service residential
                    and commercial properties in the Central Indiana area and are fully equipped to deal with every demand.

                </h1>
                Mike Lamb says that people often think of generators for winter weather-related snow storms; however, they are also important
                for alternative power during spring and summer storms, general power outages, and when power lines go down.
                Large and small generators are useful for in-home medical equipment and to keep your sump pump, freezer,
                and refrigerator working during power outages. Among many generator brands available in the market, we recommend
                the Generac brand because we researched and found that they are the best quality product for the homeowners.
                We also provide an annual monitoring service, which costs about $20 per month. Besides this, we will remotely
                monitor your generator to make sure that it is running efficiently. Are you in need of a generator for your
                home? Get in touch with us.
                <h1>Home Monitoring
                </h1>
                We can monitor your generator remotely to determine if it is functioning properly. We offer this service whether or not you
                purchased your generator from us. Contact us today to start your remote generator monitoring. Call us to
                install your generator before your power goes out! Hire us today!

                Benefits of Generators

            </h1>
            <p>
                A standby generator protects your ability to heat, cool, and light your property when an outage or disaster threatens the
                area. Maglio Electric’s certified generator specialists custom-order and install a full line of Briggs &
                Stratton generators that turn on automatically when your home’s power is disabled. Remember that generator
                installation is not a do-it-yourself project. To assure trouble-free operation and protect your family, 24/7,
                manufacturers recommend hiring an electrical professional to install your new backup power system.

            </p>

            </h1>
            <p>
                Problems that arise with DIY installation may impact warranty coverage or even void your manufacturer’s warranty entirely.
                If the generator is damaged during a do-it-yourself installation, you will also be responsible for shipping
                the generator back to the manufacturer for repairs. Maglio Electric team members are authorized Briggs &
                Stratton dealers and installers: trained and certified to install standby generators. We are also authorized
                to maintain your generator after installation to ensure years of quality performance.
