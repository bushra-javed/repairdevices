                <p>
                    Lighting is the backbone of our home and office. Without adequate lighting, life becomes an
                    argument between the senses.
                    Poor lighting can reduce the health and safety code of conduct in the workplace, and can
                    increase
                    the
                    risk of headaches and poor vision in the home. Often, a light is only noticed when it's not
                    working.
                    When considering a new lighting installation, hire an electrical contractor who has years of
                    experience
                    and can meet your standards. Lighting is also a great way to rejuvenate home and offices and
                    can
                    transform
                    your view from dull to dazzling. Burtner Electric Inc. can help you install recessed lighting,
                    indoor
                    and outdoor lighting, with a variety of custom designs.

                    Unfortunately, many people don't know they have an electric fault until it's too late. Wires
                    are
                    often hidden from view and
                    can become disrupted or damaged by severe weather, rodents, or general wear and tear. If you
                    suspect
                    that wiring has become loose from the side or roofing of your home, or the interior electrical
                    wiring
                    is “acting up,” it's time to call the pros. Carrying out an electric repair job is far more
                    cost
                    and
                    time effective than waiting for the damage to overflow. It can save you hundreds of thousands
                    of
                    dollars’
                    worth of damage. Facing electrical issues? Call Burtner Electric Inc. immediately. We service

                    We Deal in Generac Brand Generators
                </h1>
                Mike Lamb says that people often think of generators for winter weather-related snow storms; however,
                they are also important
                for alternative power during spring and summer storms, general power outages, and when power lines go
                down.
                Large and small generators are useful for in-home medical equipment and to keep your sump pump,
                freezer,
                and refrigerator working during power outages. Among many generator brands available in the market, we
                recommend
                the Generac brand because we researched and found that they are the best quality product for the
                homeowners.
                We also provide an annual monitoring service, which costs about $20 per month. Besides this, we will
                remotely
                monitor your generator to make sure that it is running efficiently. Are you in need of a generator for
                your
                home? Get in touch with us.
                <h1>Home Monitoring
                </h1>
                We can monitor your generator remotely to determine if it is functioning properly. We offer this
                service whether or not you
                purchased your generator from us. Contact us today to start your remote generator monitoring. Call us
                to
                install your generator before your power goes out! Hire us today!

                Life is less stressful when you have a “Plan B.” For over 35 years, Maglio Electric has been helping
                Hunterdon County residents
                prepare their homes for severe weather and unexpected power outages. As an authorized dealer of Briggs
                &
                Stratton generators, we are experts in the installation and maintenance of industry-leading backup

                Benefits of Generators

            </h1>
            <p>
                A standby generator protects your ability to heat, cool, and light your property when an outage or
                disaster threatens the
                area. Maglio Electric’s certified generator specialists custom-order and install a full line of Briggs
                &
                Stratton generators that turn on automatically when your home’s power is disabled. Remember that
                generator
                installation is not a do-it-yourself project. To assure trouble-free operation and protect your family,
                24/7,
                manufacturers recommend hiring an electrical professional to install your new backup power system.

                Problems that arise with DIY installation may impact warranty coverage or even void your manufacturer’s
                warranty entirely.
                If the generator is damaged during a do-it-yourself installation, you will also be responsible for
                shipping
                the generator back to the manufacturer for repairs. Maglio Electric team members are authorized Briggs
                &
                Stratton dealers and installers: trained and certified to install standby generators. We are also
                authorized
                to maintain your generator after installation to ensure years of quality performance.
